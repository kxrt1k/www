<Section title="Who am I?">
  <p class="text">
    I’m an independent design engineer who designs through code. I focus on
    crafting elegant, intuitive user interfaces with careful attention to detail
    and clarity, supported by clean, scalable code. My work sits at the
    intersection of design, engineering, and curation.

<Section title="My Work">
  <p class="text">
    I’m the founder and curator of <a
      href="https://philosophors.com"
      target="_blank">Philosophors</a
    >, a philosophical media brand and wisdom discovery engine with over one
    million people in its combined audience. I design, build, and curate the
    platform end-to-end, from interface and frontend implementation to content
    systems and editorial direction.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Alongside this, I’m also the creator and curator of <a
      href="https://noiced.com"
      target="_blank">Noiced</a
    >, a daily web design inspiration platform focused on high-quality
    interfaces and visual systems. Through Noiced, I explore patterns,
    aesthetics, and emerging practices in modern web design.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    In addition to my main ventures, I create and maintain open-source projects.
    <a href="https://moodist.mvze.net" target="_blank">Moodist</a>, an ambient
    sound web experience, has been adopted by thousands of users and has
    received over 3,000 stars on GitHub. My open-source work emphasizes
    thoughtful UX, beautiful UI, and long-term maintainability.
